The commit should follow the {{style}} format.

Important guidelines:
1. Ensure the message is under 72 characters for the first line.
2. Use present tense.
3. Focus on WHY the change was made, not just what was changed.
4. If appropriate, include a body with more details after a blank line.
5. Return ONLY the commit message without any additional formatting or explanation.
