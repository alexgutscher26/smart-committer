Generate a conventional commit message for the following code changes.

{{#if detectedScope}}Use the scope "{{detectedScope}}" if appropriate.{{/if}}
{{#if scope}}Use the specified scope "{{scope}}" if appropriate.{{/if}}

Git diff:
{{diff}}

Format the commit message as: <type>(<scope>): <description>

Where <type> is one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore
Where <scope> is the affected component or module (optional)
Where <description> is a brief description of the change

Examples:
feat(api): add new endpoint for user authentication
fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions

Important guidelines:
1. Ensure the message is under 72 characters for the first line.
2. Use present tense.
3. Focus on WHY the change was made, not just what was changed.
4. Return ONLY the commit message without any additional formatting or explanation.
